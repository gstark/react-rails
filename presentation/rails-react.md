# [fit] Rails and React

## React - Why

`React` is a `JavaScript` library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram.

Many people choose to think of React as the `V` in `MVC`.

We _[Facebook]_ built React to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time.

## Why I like React

> (disclaimer, I haven't built a production app in it)

- Doesn't take over the entire app
- Can build individual UI components
- Unidirectional data flow
- Creates a mapping between data and interface
- Data, behavior, and HTML structure are structured in components
